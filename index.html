      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I have been fixing computers, applications, and databases for over 20 years. Now I'm trying something a little different and looking forward to learning how to develop.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Charleston, South Carolina</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Lately it is spending time in my garden, but love hiking and camping also.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be working for a company that is trying to do good in the world and for humanity. I would solve puzzles all day long and have all the resources I needed to do that.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Denver, Colorado</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>This would be a pivot for me. I have 20 years of experience troubleshooting computers, applications and databases. I would like to take that knowledge and work to improve processes to make people's lives better. </p>
